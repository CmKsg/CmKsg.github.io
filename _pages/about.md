Hi! My name is Cem (pronounced Gem). I am a machine learning engineering engineering currently working with GPT and statistical models at TotalSoft. During undergrad, I pivoted to the information and optimization stream, focusing on algorithm design, operations research, data science and risk analysis. As such, I'm interested in optimization, machine learning, website development and data analysis. I'm proficient with Python (Torch, Pandas, Sklearn), Java, SQL and R.

This personal website will be where I display my portfolio of projects, keep logs of my ongoing projects and write down any research that I may do. It is linked to both my LinkedIn profile and Github profile, so feel free to check those out!
